## Welcome to Smoothandbumpy's Powershell Repository

The purpose of this repository is to store and share functions I have made in powershell that other may find useful. Some functions may require a little personalization so please read all notes.

Each Function will have a help system built into the functions and I highly recommend you build your fucntions into a module for eas of use. 

Thanks for viewing.
